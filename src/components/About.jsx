                    Hello !<span style={{color:'#d4af37'}}>I'm Dinesh,</span> a passionate and dedicated web developer with a focus on building responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications.
                    I have experience working with modern web technologies such as <span style={{color:'#d4af37'}}>React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS,</span> as well as backend frameworks like <span style={{color:'#d4af37'}}>Node.js and MongoDB.</span>

                <p>
                    My journey into web development began with an interest in design and problem-solving. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in front-end development
                    using React and other JavaScript frameworks. I'm also experienced in building cross-platform mobile apps using React Native.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. Whether it's building websites, web apps, or mobile apps, I strive to
                    deliver high-quality solutions that make an impact. When I'm not coding, I love exploring new technologies, learning about UX/UI design, and collaborating with teams.
